## About

Keylaunch is a Rainmeter skin that lets you easily launch apps with a hotkey. The application hotkey list is extremely simple to configure, and you can even change the action's name and icon. There are four different types of animation presets to choose from and configure based on your preferences. **See the video linked above.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keylaunch by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keylaunch** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keylaunch**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keylaunch**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

## Configuration

Now that you've installed Keylaunch, let's configure it! There are two different ways you can configure it as shown below.

### Hotkey Setup

#### Default Configuration:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
3. Under **List of actions**, press the edit button to create a new hotkey for a specific application.
    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

4. Press the **Quick Start** button and select the application shortcut for which you're setting the hotkey. **Please note the shortcut has to be in `.lnk` format.**
5. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the action you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**

6. Enter the hotkey and press confirm.
7. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

#### Custom Icon Configuration:

Even when manually configuring an action, you have two options. They are, in turn, as follows:

##### Method 1:

1. Create a shortcut with the custom icon and place it anywhere. **Make sure the shortcut has the `.lnk` extension.**
2. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
3. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
4. Under **List of actions**, create a new action using the **Add an action** button.
5. Press the edit button to create a new hotkey for a specific application.
    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/PNFKsqD.png" alt = "ref" width="221" height ="60">

6. Click on the **Quick Start** button and select the custom shortcut you creatd in **Step 1**.
7. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the action you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/mdgm9No.png" alt = "ref" width="217" height ="62">

8. Enter the hotkey and press confirm.
9. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

##### Method 2:

1. Navigate to `Documents\Rainmeter\CoreData\Keylaunch\IconCache`.
2. Transfer the image file that will be used as your icon to the **IconCache** folder. Please keep note of the file name as we will be needing it later.
**Also, make sure the image has the `.png` extension.**
3. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
4. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
5. Under **List of actions**, create a new action using the **Add an action** button.
6. Click the edit button to create a new hotkey for a particular application.
    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/PNFKsqD.png" alt = "ref" width="221" height ="60">

7. Click on the **Quick Start** button and select the application shortcut for which you're setting the hotkey. **Please note the shortcut has to be in `.lnk` format.**
8. After you've chosen the shortcut, click on the icon and change the name of the icon to the name of the custom icon image(refer to **Step 2** for the file name), then press **Enter** on your keyboard and **Confirm**. **Make sure you do not include the `.png` while passing the image name.**
9. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the action you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/mdgm9No.png" alt = "ref" width="217" height ="62">

10. Enter the hotkey and press confirm.
11. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

* **Note:** To add a new action, simply press the **Add an action** button and follow either of the methods described above.

### Animation Selection

1. Once you're done setting up a hotkey, navigate to the **Animations** tab.
2. Choose one of the five animation presets available. **Expand**, **Enlarge**, **Traynotif**, **Skewed**, and **Spin** are the available presets.
3. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.
