## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v44703 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keylaunch by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keylaunch** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keylaunch**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keylaunch**.

> Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

#### Custom Icon Configuration:

Even when manually configuring an action, you have two options. They are, in turn, as follows:

##### Method 1:

1. Create a shortcut with the custom icon and place it anywhere. **Make sure the shortcut has the `.lnk` extension.**
2. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
3. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
4. Under **List of actions**, create a new action using the **Add an action** button.
5. Press the edit button to configure the action.
    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

6. Click on the **Quick Start** button and select the custom shortcut you creatd in **Step 1**.
7. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the action you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**

8. Enter the hotkey and press confirm.
9. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

##### Method 2:

1. Navigate to `Documents\Rainmeter\CoreData\Keylaunch\IconCache`.
2. Transfer the image file that will be used as your icon to the **IconCache** folder. Please keep note of the file name as we will be needing it later.
**Also, make sure the image has the `.png` extension.**
3. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
4. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
5. Under **List of actions**, create a new action using the **Add an action** button.

    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/PNFKsqD.png" alt = "ref" width="221" height ="60">

7. Click on the **Quick Start** button and select the application shortcut for which you're setting the hotkey. **Please note the shortcut has to be in `.lnk` format.**
8. After you've chosen the shortcut, click on the icon and change the name of the icon to the name of the custom icon image(refer to **Step 2** for the file name), then press **Enter** on your keyboard and **Confirm**. **Make sure you do not include the `.png` while passing the image name.**
9. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the action you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**

      <img src ="https://imgur.com/mdgm9No.png" alt = "ref" width="217" height ="62">

10. Enter the hotkey and press confirm.
11. Refresh **Keylaunch** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

* **Note:** To add a new action, simply press the **Add an action** button and follow either of the methods described above.
