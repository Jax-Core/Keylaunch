Keylaunch is a Rainmeter skin that brings pattern and combination lock functionality to PC, influenced by the combination locks available on phones. It supports custom-drawn pattern styles and offers a wide variety of customization options.

## Features

* Custom-drawn Lock Patterns
* Vast Customization Options 
* Easy to Setup and Configure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keylaunch by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keylaunch** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keylaunch**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keylaunch**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Configuration

Now that you've installed Keylaunch, let's configure it!

1. Click on the **System Tray** in the bottom right corner of your taskbar. 
    - **Note:** The System Tray is indicated by the small upward pointing arrow. For reference, see the image below.

2. Right click on the Rainmeter icon and select **Manage**.
3. Expand the **Keylaunch** folder from the left-pane when the manage window opens.
4. Within that folder, expand **@Settings** and then select `Main.ini`.
5. Now, on the right, press **Load** to load the ini file. This will open the Keylaunch configuration menu, where you can customize the pattern locks.
6. Select **Actions** from the hamburger menu.
7. Click the **`+`** icon to create a new lock for a specific application.
8. Enter a name for the action, draw a pattern for the lock, and then select the application (shortcut is recommended) to which the lock is being added.
9. Refresh Rainmeter, and your app-lock should now function properly.

- **Note:** Further customization can be done through the **Appearance** tab.
