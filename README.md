## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005 or newer.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keylaunch by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keylaunch** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keylaunch**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keylaunch**.

* Note:  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Configuration

Now that you've installed Keylaunch, let's configure it!

#### Setting up a hotkey:

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **Keylaunch** from the list and proceed to the **Actions** tab.
3. Under **List of actions**, press the edit button to create a new hotkey for a specific application.
    - **Note:** The edit button is indicated by the small green colored pen icon just next to `Edit..`. For reference, see the image below.

4. Press the **Quick Start** button and select the application shortcut for which you're setting the hotkey. **Please note the shortcut has to be in `.lnk` format.**
5. Click the `Edit..` text to set the hotkey for the application you just created.
    - **Note:** For reference, see the image below. **It's highlighted in grey.**
